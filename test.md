Now let’s see how the countries compare with regards to their population growth rate, meaning the percentage change in population compared to the previous year. We can drag population Growth to Color on the Marks card. Notice that the default aggregation is SUM. Let’s change this to average. Then, we can click Color on the Marks card and add a black border around the circles, and remove the halo. This makes the circles stand out more from the grey map image. We can see by the orange circles that some countries’ population declined from 2007 to 2008. Note that although measures with negative values are not recommended on Size, they work really well on Color. You can adjust the background map settings too. Select the Map menu, then click Map Layers. The Map Layers pane will appear on the left panel. We can unselect Land Cover and select Coast Line. You can see how the map view changes with each selection. Looks good right? Symbol maps are great if you want to show two measures on the same map. Both circle size and color carry information we can use to make decisions. Okay, let’s practice.
